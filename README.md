It’s a space built for sharing stories that can uplift, encourage, and impact lives around the world.

## 📝 Project Overview

I built InspireMe because my girlfriend has been a great motivator in my life.  
She constantly pushes me to achieve more, and her encouragement has inspired me to dedicate this app to her.  

Through InspireMe, I want to create a platform that helps people stay motivated, chase their goals, and share their own journeys.  
It brings me joy knowing this app could help others find the motivation they need, just as I have.
